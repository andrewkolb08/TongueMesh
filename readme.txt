Tongue Mesh Readme

Matlab code used to create a tongue mesh from the EMA-MAE database data.
Example data is provided in the data directory for a single subject.

To plot this subject's data as an example, simply run the script 
newestTongueMesh.m.  This will plot an example spectrogram and tongue
mesh tool for visualizing the tongue movement over the course of the word.

To plot any arbitrary subject's tongue mesh in the EMA-MAE database,
use viewTongueAndSpec.m with the proper parameter inputs (described in
the file).
